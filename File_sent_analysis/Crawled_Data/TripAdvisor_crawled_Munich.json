{"Review": ["Whilst working in Munich I went to \"Taverna Limani\" with 2 work colleagues, one of whom is part Greek. The ambiance at the restaurant certainly had a pulse and a good vibe to it. The owner / manager (George if I remember correctly) made us feel very welcome and ensured that we had a memorable meal and dinner experience, and we certainly did. We all loved it. We ordered a load of food, (George said we'd never eat it all but we sure did as it was too delicious to leave anything!), as there was so much on the menu we wanted to experience. We had about 6 starters, a main Mousaka and the Grilled Meat Gyros platter for 3. I say it again it was all top quality, amazingly cooked Greek food. Dog's are welcome and there was a friendly Husky on the table next to us who became our best friend as it's owner said it was okay to feed her our lamb chop bones and our few Gyros left-overs! Prices are very reasonable, we had an absolute top quality feast, a bottle of wine, Metaxa's and soft drinks too and our bill came to US$163.50 Highly recommended and would love to eat here again next time I visit Munich."], "Review_title": ["Probably the most enjoyable Greek Restaurant I've ever eaten in."], "Star": 5.0, "Rating_Date": ["June 18, 2019"], "Restaurant_Name": [" Taverna Limani "]}

It is a mystery to me how this is possible. Compared with numerous dining experiences in Munich and elsewhere this one was average. The whole experience was fine and trouble free but very little struck me as above average. The service was better than expected for Munich and Germany but inline with a broad range of dining experiences in many other locations. While waiting for my guest I had a Tegernsee dunkles (dark) beer, which is my favourite and not readily available in most venues, so they deserve credit for that. We ordered the fish and the meat plates respectively. Reasonably priced and the food was a fair reflection of that. We shared a decent bottle of Rioja wine and each had reasonable deserts (creme brulee and baklava). The atmosphere was pleasant and peaceful but lacked vibe that makes a significant difference to the ambiance. The restaurant, modernly decorated and clean, remained well occupied during our stay and people seem to enjoy themselves based on them returning empty plates as we did. I had made a reservation for a Friday evening although it might not have been essential as the turnover of the tables was quite efficient.

Situated in a nice suburb a couple of stops on the S-bahn we were met by the owner and friendly waiters. Food was excellent and good value for money.

{"Review": ["After a very long walk around the Nymphenburg Castle (Palace), including an unsuccessful attempt to find an exit from the gardens nearer to Naxos Taverna, my friend and I decided to trek backwards to the main entrance to the Palace to head down the road to Naxos Taverna. I think we can both agree quite comfortably that this 45-minute walk or so was well-worth our time. Upon arriving at Naxos, we were greeted with three true Greek smiles. Upon hearing our background and our Greek tongues our hosts showed an intricate interest both in our stories and our comfort. A shot of Ouzo to start was a refreshingly Greek way of dining. The food itself is the best we have discovered in the beautiful town of Munich. We tried a selection of starters, all of which had a unique (perhaps Munich-inspired) twist to them which kept our taste buds guessing their next destinations. I would highly recommend trying their pita alongside your main meal; it is unlike any I have tasted before, resembling a flat bread sprinkled with the most delicate combination of spices. The main meals are best described as clean and true. With no overpowering flavours, the mixed grill of meats was a tribute to Greece with a modern hint of fine dining. An espresso freddo (a most welcome close to our meal at Naxos) was our final order of the day. As our waiter laughingly pointed out, our coffees hardly had any resting time on our table, as we thoroughly enjoyed our coffees in the most minimal time humanly possible. Following our coffees, we were treated to a shot of raki infused with honey; a gesture of Greek spirit. Our hosts, specifically Niko, was in no rush to either bring us our bill or chase us out of the restaurant. We continued chatting with out hosts and each other for a good 2.5 hours post-meal, with no interrupting glares or pushy service. Niko was more than willing to call us a cab once we had decided to move on in our journey of Munich. Overall, I can only praise Naxos Taverna. A well-priced meal capable of matching the world's very best! Compares very favorably to a number of perhaps more tourist-oriented restaurants in town, both in terms of price and more importantly food quality. We left with content hearts and confident strides simply brought on by good food. We promised Niko we'd visit again on our last night in Munich. Thanks very much to the whole team at Naxos!

The portions are too big and I would prefer smaller portions at a lower price, which doesn't mean that the dishes are not good value for money.

We are clueless and confused in the Munich suburbs. Based on Tripadvisor recommendations, we walk from our hotel to this restaurant. We walk into the restaurant aimlessly, not yet used to not being seated by a hostess as is common at home. The proprietor comes out from behind the bar, recognizes what's happened, greets us warmly and instructs us to find a seat. We take a seat on the lovely patio and, via a game of charades, order our meals. I order the Pola-Pola which was grilled meat and rice. The portion is huge and delicious. I also try a Colaweizen - beer and cola. I never did figure out if this something Germans really drink, or if it's something they just sell to trick tourists, but I won't lie - I had more than a few during my trip! We are treated with friendly laughs and encouragement as we bumble our way through paying, tipping and attempting to speak German.

We were happy we went then as it got very busy about a half an hour later. The menu is all in German so we asked a few questions and then ordered several different meals to share along with appetizers. It was all very good, I especially liked the Souvlaki. I don't remember the names of the appetizers, but we liked all of them. This is a charming family run restaurant, you feel like they really care that you have a good experience. In the middle of the meal the owner brought over 4 shots of Ouzo for the girls and me to try, it was a nice touch. The desserts were good too.

That perfectly combines some typical german dishes with everything we love about simple, french cooking. On a perfect day, sit outside and don't be surprised if a fur baby is under a table close by.

The carpaccio was served perfectly; the flavor of the beef shining through. The pasta aglio e oglio was done to perfection, as was the branzino fish. The molten chocolate cake and limoncello topped off a perfect dinner.

Despite being a 30minute walk, we jumped in a taxi as the rain began to fall: and we were so glad that we did. This restaurant is an absolute delight. My husband tried the alligator rolls as a starter. However their steaks are the dishes to be highly recommended. The restaurant is not large, but we were made to feel so welcome. Mario Hasler, the owner and chef came to chat to us after our meal and it was like dining amongst friends.

{"Review": ["I almost didn't want to write this review because I wanted to keep this place to myself, but I guess that's selfish of me. This hidden gem of a restaurant is tucked away in a residential enclave, attached to a hotel (forgot the name of the hotel, sorry!). With only 7 tables, seating a maximum of 20 people, the decor is embroidered linen tablecloths, luxe red walls and gilded mirrors, a sharp contrast to the twangy Americana music. The steaks are delicious, ranging from black pepper to ribeye to filets to Cajun chicken, all at incredibly reasonable prices (all around 20 Euros). The chef offers a delicious amuse-bouche (ours was a giant, succulent cooked shrimp wrapped in a buttery piece of bread), and always pops his head out to check whether you like the food or not. For our appetizer, we got the bruschetta, which was a super-sized Texan version of the traditional Italian dish: four large, buttery pieces of toast with three different toppings of a slightly fruity butter, thick smoked ham slices, and an olive tapenade. The steaks came out a perfectly cooked medium. Food portions are generous, service is impeccably friendly and efficient, and you just can't beat the friendliness and attention the chef lavishes on you. All in all, you come out wondering how a place like this stays under the radar, while simultaneously hoping that it stays a poorly-kept secret."], "Review_title": ["Hidden Gem of a Place"], "Star": 5.0, "Rating_Date": ["October 31, 2013"], "Restaurant_Name": [" Restaurant P.Korn "]}

His wife (I guess so, am not sure) supplements the service and is there whenever you need something.- It is a great family enterprise with a touch of gourmet-culture. - The people there do love food, and they love to share their ardor of the good cuisine with us, their guest. - A clear recommendation if you are in Munich, can approach Neuhausen (about 10 minutes form Main Train Station to the West) and are lucky to get a table there. - Albrecht Schnabel Munich."], "Review_title": ["Great modern cuisine with an austrian chef and an emphasis on excellent steaks"], "Star": 5.0, "Rating_Date": ["May 1, 2015"], "Restaurant_Name": [" Restaurant P.Korn "]}

We were accomodated at a nice table, the 4 of us, and the courteous staff came and took the orders bringing immediately a lovely Sicilian bread covered with sesame seeds. We had vitello tonnato,dates wrapped in speck with a generous salad, orange Sicilian salad with grilled octopus. Dishes perfectly prepared and offered, gorgeous taste. Then risotto with fresh vegetables, risotto with truffle, risotto with wild mushrooms and baby calamari with steamed vegetables. Needless to say, look at the name of the restaurant, that the risotti were great and perfectly cooked ( and most restaurants make mistakes on the cooking time) with balanced taste and enough creamy using only the ingredients that the tradition foresees. Baby calamari as well were delicious. Take your time in this restaurant. The waiting time is gonna be rewarded with the freshness of your dishes, clearly made at the moment.

We then asked for the bill for the food eaten and they asked us to wait and never brought it. Finally we paid them and got out of them hellhole starving and severely disappointed.

Our drinks were delivered promptly and then one of the chefs came out to talk us through some of the main thai ingredients. We decided to be guided by his recommendations and went for the appetiser from the specials menu (finely sliced and roasted shallots, lemongrass, garlic & ginger on a leaf that could be rolled and eaten in one - beautiful) along with the prawn fish cakes with a sweet dipping sauce. Mains were a lightly fried fish with an intense salty/sweet sauce and more of that beautifully roasted lemongrass, shallot, garlic and ginger deliciousness, along with a stir fried chicken with string beans in a sweet soy sauce, thai basil and mint. The flavours were stunning, the service was excellent and I would eat here every day if I could.

Everything we had was very good and would recommend including the Veal Goulash, Pork Roast, Pretzel Breaded Schnitzel, Cream of Herbs Soup and Sauerkraut.

The Schnitzel has two large pieces in the regular portion and the waiter mentioned you could get a smaller portion (not on the menu) with just one piece.

{"Review": ["The place is cosy, cocktails were good (and not very strong in alcohol, which suits me but may not be to everyone's liking) and there was a nice choice of everything in the menu. Few vegetarian dishes, but South African cooking is mainly about eating lots of meat, so not necessarily the ideal place to go if you're vegetarian. We had a burger, very good and very big, and some barbecue meat. Beef was delicious, crocodile a bit overcooked, very nice veggies and sweet potatoe fries on the side. Wine looked a bit overpriced to me (I buy south African wine myself to drink at home, so I know how much it costs) and the service was nice but a bit too \"present\" . I personally don't like being asked every 5 minutes if everything's OK or if I would like to order more water/wine/sauce/whatever, although I'm in the middle of a conversation or have my mouth full. Maybe American style service? Well other people seem to have enjoyed it...

The owners and our server were actually from Greece and very helpful in selection. Great ambience! The food is delicious and the portions are very large, especially by European standards. We started off with a cold assortment with a variety of dips, calamari, pita bread, and cheese. It was so great and could defiantly have been split by 4 people- so fillings! For our main course we split a grilled mix for two- 2 salads, beef, chicken and lamb. Also, delicious and an awesome change from the veal and pork heavy restaurants in Munich. This main dish says it is for 2, but could easily be 3-4. We ended up taking home a good portion of the meat and eating it for lunch the next day! Highly recommend!

The staff was professional and attentive, and they even hand-wrote us a congratulatory card for our wedding (which we were celebrating with our dinner there). They were also well equipped for international guests as several of our servers were able to translate all dishes perfectly into English. Regarding the food: we went for the Traditional 6 course menu and loved every dish. A balanced mix of meat and seafood accompanied by regional delicacies unfolded deliciously over a few hours, interspersed with refreshers from the kitchen and very tasty homemade focaccia bread. We did a modified wine pairing (because of budget! The wine is quite expensive) that was really enjoyable and different. As for the overall experience, Esszimmer manages to be a very comfortable, warm space despite its location in a glass box above lots of steel and metal. The dominant sensation is elegance and we did feel the presence of those two Michelin stars! Our only criticism would be the timing - between a few courses we felt that the wait time was a bit too stretched out.

{"Review": ["To have a perfect ending of our Europe trip, we decided to come to Thalassa to try the Hellenic cuisine (i.e. Greek cuisine). We started with the fish soup which was made with several different fish. Then the surprisingly delicious Octopus salad. The octopus is a big one because all we had us one tentacle (see photo) but it was cooked perfectly. Not over cooked and its tender, juicy, chewy, and good texture. We also ordered the eggplant in oven as another stater. The eggplant was sliced to fold with a bacon (?) and filled with cheese. It was then baked in an oven with an orange color sauce. One of best eggplant dishes we ever tasted. Knowing all the dishes are great, we ordered the seafood plate and meat combo dish. The owner was nice enough to prepare special dishes for us to included all fresh ingredients. For seafood plate, a king size prawn with several fresh squids were grilled. It also came with a sole and several grilled vegetables. Meat dishes -wise, a lamp chop, burger, steaks and gyros. All these were grilled perfectly with their original flavors. All these were grilled so good, tender, juicy with their original flavors to be tasted so heavenly. We ordered an ice cream to end our meal and the waiter recommended to have chocolate sauce with it. Both ice cream and chocolate were not sweet and match perfectly to bring all the flavors out. No doubt at all, this is the best Greek meal we ever have and help to confirm our Greek trip in the near future.

All their tables were full, but they said we could sit at the bar and order food there if we'd like, and then they would be happy to move us once a table became available. We told them we were happy to eat at the bar, but just after we had ordered, a great table came open and they moved us there. They were so friendly about it, and I appreciated that they were so willing to help us out when it was my error. We had an absolutely delicious dinner- we both ordered steaks since this is, after all, a steakhouse. My tenderloin was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was delicious as well. And the meal was very reasonably priced for the quality of the food and the excellent service and lively atmosphere.

If you are lucky, our great waiter who comes from Gera will be around to chat to you and enlighten you about wine. I will definitely come again. Great for special occasions (not for families though).

The only reason I took one star away was because we had a table with a window into the kitchen and their pastry chef kept putting things in his mouth! He put his mouth around the piping bag he was using on one of the desserts and I also saw him put his tweezers in his mouth a few times.

{"Review": ["This restaurant had been booked from the UK based on its high Munich ranking and reputation. Unfortunately some health issues detracted from our party's enjoyment; we kept our booking because of the financial penalties if we had defaulted. The menu was a no-choice four-course plus dessert affair. Unlike many other restaurants we have patronised, this was on the casual side, but booked out a couple of months in advance. It was more like a wine bar serving food. Regardless of the health issues, it did not quite \"cut it\" for us. None of us really enjoyed the roasted swordfish, but the venison was beautifully cooked. However, given that the menu changes, and you do not get to choose, anyway, our experience may be irrelevant.

The restaurant features a set menu (up to 5 courses) with optional wine pairing. The menu was a bit strange and featured things like cold pea soup with small \"tasting\" portions. The staff would tell stories about why each wine was selected for each course, which made the meal rather drawn out and long. Bottom line is that you got to taste small servings of \"interesting\" although not necessarily tasty food which is pre-selected for you along with small servings of different wines to try. It's very expensive, especially for what you get ($450 for 3 adults) and we didn't even opt for the 5th course of dessert.

The actual room is quite small but this makes for an intimate and relaxed setting in which you can enjoy the spectacular food. The sommelier recommended a fantastic Austrian wine which we thoroughly enjoyed and complimented our food very well. We didn't decide to have the wine pairing as we wanted some bubbly to start and a bottle to share, but I am sure this would have been equally as good. The attention to detail was brilliant on all the dishes we sampled and for each of the five courses we were told a little about the dish. I felt the service could not have been better and the restaurant organised a taxi for us at the end of the meal. If I had one criticism it would only be that the restaurant was quite bright inside for an evening meal and the atmosphere may have benefited from the lighting being dimmed slightly.

The single set menu was excellent, six courses. We appreciated the offer to vary things based on either of our preferences, but it wasn't needed. A strong foundation in seasonal availability, and imaginative yet simple formulations characterised our meal. We took the matching wine package and delighted that we did; the charming, friendly sommelier truly knows and loves his work, and we were able to explore some German and Austrian wines that we don't come across so commonly in the UK, due to both tiny production volumes from some of these vineyards and probably residual prejudice based on Liebfraumilch!

Pizza very generous in size and condiments, with real parmigiano and real cured meat from Italy. Gnocchi with pistachio filling and truffle extremely good and green tagliatelle with pfefferling mushroom balanced in taste and absolutely gorgeous.

We closed the dinner with strawberry with mascarpone, a sort of special one it seems and crema catalana quite unusual but very good and light.

The menu had (as the name indicated) truffles in every course and the food was absolutely heavenly. The best dish for me was a simple home-made tagliatelle with cream sauce topped with fresh grated truffle (grated over the dish at the table). Incredible taste! The wines we had were all Austrian, an excellent brut bubbly that I've forgotten the name of, and an excellent blend called \"K\". Beautiful stuff that matched our food excellently. The service was friendly, if slightly chaotic (very busy night) and everyone seemed to really care about what they were doing and know everything about the food and the wine. The only thing that dampened our pleasure was that no one said goodbye to us when we left...but..again...it was a busy night. The vibe was very jolly. The place is rather small, but a surprising number of guests seemed to be locals and regulars. I was expecting a more \"touristy\" crowd because of the place's Tripadvisor standings.

We had a truly magical evening here. Place is intimate, and staff talk to you and explain the menu like you're old friends. I opted for the paired wine choices - do it. Austrian wines are now things I lust after, especially the dessert wine made of quince that appeared with final course. They were very accommodating of my fussy eater husband and switched a few things around for him. Now for the food... artichoke soup... grilled pike with shavings of \"Buddha's Fingers\" this crazy imported citrus fruit... wild mushrooms... the tenderest venison... cheese... was fairly pissed by the time dessert arrived but it was some kind of mouth-melting crumbly fruit concoction. We both tried things we'd never eaten before, loved the combination of tastes and flavours, and with the wine as well (they are quite generous with the wine, did I mention?) it was the best meal we've had in ages. So it totally lives up to the hype of its top billed rating, and has thankfully not been spoilt by it either.

Straight forward - choose the number of courses you want between 4 and 9 and they take all the angst away by simply providing, explaining each course and selecting the appropriate wine.

We came here last night for dinner and loved every meal. The woman chef (our fault for not asking her name) was able to translate the dishes in English to us (we are from USA). We started with the pumpkin soup oh my it was so delightful and opposite of what I imagined (rich, creamy and filling.) It was so light to the spoonful and the touch of balsamic vinegar (or that's what we thought haha) added nice flavor. Next we had the arugula salad which is so simple but when you have such simple ingredients (arugula, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, fresh parmesean cheese and a small dash of pesto sauce) that is all you need! Next up our main pasta dishes - the best part! We had the pasta with ricotta cheese and sage oh my melt in your mouth the most delicious sauce I have ever had. Then we had the pasta with beef and red pesto. Definitely different flavors and the meat was so tender. We heated up both our dishes that we had taken to go in our hotel before heading to the airport. Who knew we would have such a lovely Italian dinner in Munich!

So rare will be just right! In here, rare is rare! YEAH! I love that! Rich in taste, not too fat but tender! The guy on the next table ordered the roast beef, rare, of cause!

But this drink was refreshing and delicious. I liked it so much I ended up buying one of there bottles of Little London gin to bring home. The locale was charming, and the staff was friendly and attentive. My one complaint was the appetizers. I had essentially an appetizer sampler and really didn't like any of the appetizers.

I asked the waiter what he recommended for a vegetarian and took the appetizer, main dish, and even the wine he suggested to go with it (an Italian red from Puglia) -- it was all amazing.

During the time we were there, the restaurant did fill up, and I am glad we could wrap up our dinner just in time to leave the spot for the reservation. Now for the food. This was our first brush with Afghani food. We were guided well through the menu, and believe we made good choices. The food was so delicious and full of aromas. Every course was better than the previous, with the dessert of delectable baklava being the undisputed grand finale. What made the experience that much special was the staff's caring hospitality.

Each staff member had multiple roles (e.g., bartender, host, server, expediter) to perform. One note: their menu is only in German but they were more than happy to assist and translate for us.

The lamb in one of the mains was the nicest lamb I've ever eaten. All four dishes were light but intensely flavoured with fresh spices like cardamom. And the bread was so good we ordered another basket. The decor is elegant and the staff super friendly with fantastic English. They told us the other two Chopans Munich are owned by the same family.
