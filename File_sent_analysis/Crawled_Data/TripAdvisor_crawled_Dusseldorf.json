We went for dinner and my wife and I selected the Omakase menu. When we asked whether this menu is also offered with accompanying wines the Sommelier told us that there is no option like this, but that he can select wines by the glas, and put something together for us. When asked whether we are also interested to sample some sake we agreed that it can be a mix of wines and sakes. Boy have we been surprised when the bill came, and it turned out that the accompanying wines and sakes were more expensive than the two menues. I think it should not be necessary to inquire about the price when asking for such an arrangement, but it can not be that this turns out to be such a substantial addition to your bill without any agreement from the customer side. We paid the Euro 550 for two menus, a bottle of water and accompanying wines, and decided to never return."], "Review_title": ["Beware when allowing the Sommelier to select for you"], "Star": 1.0, "Rating_Date": ["September 3, 2015"], "Restaurant_Name": [" Nagaya "]}

They laid one, but they told us that it's not possible to use it because the space is not enough inside (although it was) I mean it's only a small high chair.

We're really like super hungry and travelled for like 2hrs just to queued and try what they have. They don't even said I'm sorry. So we went outside and went to other restaurant near from that place.

Then saying after 5 minutes, at 8 o' clock: \"Just take your time, we are open till 10\". Supposed to be a joke, but not really funny. All in all it feels like they don't want you to have a relaxed visit, but more like they want as much people as possible eating (and paying) as fast as possible.

{"Review": ["On a Saturday evening a friend and I wanted to try it out after reading the positive reviews. We came in and were placed next to the bar to wait for a table. I don't have a problem with waiting to make that clear, but we got the impression that the waitress completely ignored us. The couple who arrived one minute ahead of us got a menu so they could already see what they offered, so did the guy who came after us. We didn't. We saw a lot of people pay and leave for about ten to fifteen minutes. I don't know their seating system but if approx. 10 people leave in ten minutes shouldn't there be at least on table for two people. when we finally got a table (It was an 8-10 persons table and nobody else was sitting there). We ordered Kimchi and Veggie Babicup as starters. For those vegetarians like myself who don't know what Babicup is, it's vegetarian sushi and tastes totally fishy. Not my thing at all. The kimchi was very spicy. Although we told them that we wanted those as starters we got them at the same time as our main dish. Not ideal if you ask me. We ordered Bibimcup Bubu (Tofu) and Bibimcup Jap-Chae (glass noodles). Well to put it like this: I could have done that myself at home. They just put rice and a few vegetables together and the tofu was just fried not even flavoured, as was the rest of the dish. Totally bland and missing spices. At first we also wanted to order dessert but after the starters and the main dish were a disappointment we didn't order dessert. I definitely won't go back there. (A friend of us who goes there regularly told us afterwards that the veggie dishes aren't good, you have to order a meat dish.

We attended with a group of 10. A couple of the attendees live in Dusseldorf and dine regularly in a good Italian restaurant in Dusseldorf. They agreed that the food at this restaurant was simply superior in every way. We ended up spending quite a bit because we drank 1.5 bottles of nice wine per adult, plus another couple of mixed drinks and champagne per person, but the price was fair for the quality of the food, drinks and service. When you have had your fix of German food and need a change, consider this excellent Italian restaurant as a great alternative.

Maybe some other items in the menu might be better tasting, so please check carefully what people like in this place before you go.

Also the service is very friendly and has his wholesome feeling.

You then get to sit on rather uncomfortable chairs belonging to small tables in a crowded...let's call it a terrase, but it's more like part of the alley. The waiters seem to be lost in time and space. Took forever to order and I didn't get what I ordered in the end. Sadly I also speak italian so I know they're rude too, not towards the guests but among themselves. The pizza was really good but I wouldn't go back. Maybe they get good reviews because once the pizza gets there it's really good. But the overall experience sucks.

We could have just ordered one for the two of us. When we left, the owner guessed we had found the place through TripAdvisor, and had a picture taken with my wife, proudly holding up the Trip Advisor picture from the wall.

Last week, even though my friend and I arrive very late on the Friday night, we simply had to head to the Aldstadt, and after one drink in Suttons, just across the road, we couldn't wait to get back into O'Reilly's, and it didn't disappoint. There are 2 bars, one on street level, and another one downstairs. We prefer the downstair action, as it is always crammed with happy friendly people, totally into their karaoke, and as I have said before, it always amazes us that all of these German people sing in English. The atmosphere in here is amazing, and you know what, if someone picked me up and dropped me in here blindfolded, I swear I would still recognise that I was in O'Reilly's. One of the regular singers in here is Hans, we have seen him everytime we were in here, though my friend says he didn't remember him, and thought that I had obviously read about him in another review, but the truth is that I noticed his popularity on my first visit. The truth is the regulars love him, but sorry to tell you this Hans, you ain't going to win Germany's got talent any time soon, but you are an entertainer, and a big crowd pleaser. I would ask you to make sure you don't miss a trip to O'Reilly's if ever you find yourself in Dusseldorf. One thing I know for certain is that I will be back.

You can smell the fresh ingredients and it fills you up just enough so you have room for dessert and you can accompany the wine. The Pizza is charaterized by a thin, stable dough or base spread out enough so you might savor the different ingredients without being overwhelmed by a mass of crust. Salvatore uses fresh ingredients and is very felxible when it comes down to adding or removing ingredients to the pizza. It is fantastic if you can speak a little Italian.

I washed mine down with a half litre of soft red house wine for 8 euros and was perfectly enthralled. Although busy on a Saturday night, the staff made a real fuss of us and we had a brilliant evening. The other food (not pizzas) coming out of the kitchen looked equally appetising.

As a starter the sashimi mix on rice. I can appreciate that the chef uses left-overs creatively in order to make something nice of it, but being served a jungle of raw fish parts in all different shapes and cooked shrimps is NOT a great example of SASHIMI! I definitely hope that I was the only one(as non Japanese) that night who was served this disgraceful peace of ugly mix of what was supposed to be sashimi, otherwise I might change my perception that Japanese people do not compromise when it comes down to freshness, quality and perfection! The gyoza was Okay, but in my desperate attempts to finish this meal positively, I ordered Wagyu beef on the grill. Normally this combination(perfect piece of meat over charcoal grill) is very difficult to mess with unless... Yes, unless you either grill the hell out of the steak or deceive people by using ancient tenderizing techniques of the Asian cuisine to make average quality beef more tender.. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they destroyed the beef by over-grilling it. Either way, a shame to serve this dish to your customers!

Ok - Michelin star dining its not - but who can afford that. On the other hand this place dishes out a pretty wide range of great tasting dishes, that are a significant cut above the usual German stodgy pub food - the kitchen here is definitely aiming at a gastro pub standard. When we arrived, the place was packed with locals - possibly because Germany was playing Algeria in the World Cup later that night. The friendly staff found a table for us, and better yet they volunteered a menu in English, although the weekly specials card was only available in German. We both ordered off the specials menus and were both really happy with our choices - a salmon & spinach lasagne with salad for me, and a hot slices of rolled pork roast with chantarelle/pfiffilinge mushroom sauce and potato croquets for my husband.

I've had better Frijoles elsewhere and i think it tastes better when served with tortillas or something. In our Mix Teller were 3 small tacos, which were tasty but difficult to eat (another friend who ordered Tacos had the same problem), 2 quesadillas were okay, and 2 Burritos were absolutely DELICIOUS! I also tried some Guacamole from a friend, it was very disappointing and almost bland. They don't have too much choice for dessert so had the crepe and the brownie. Both sounded ordinary but were very very yummy. The place is quite small, the seating a bit too tight and crammed. The service, for some reason very unfriendly and almost a bit rude. No smile.

And that's forgive able if the quality is very high, but my ( modest) portion of fish came with a couple of slices of potato and carrot, and a couple of small sprigs of green veg. All of which were so hard/ undercooked that they were very hard indeed to cut with my (fish) knife. By the glass, only Turkish wine is served (obviously not of great quality) and it's overpriced at over 6 euros a glass. For a glass of wine and a main course each, two of us paid 72 euros, and did not feel we'd had very much for our money.

{"Review": ["Definitely worth tasting if you are into asian cuisine, easy one of the best japanese restaurants in town. Let me set somethings straight from the beginning, so that you can also understand the negativ critics people have made. Firstly you can't make a reservation here. You have to stand in line outside. For the winter they have a hot air heater (like house painters use to dry inside spaces) under the long bench to sit. The line is always long, so be patient. And the staff is japanese. It all has to do with that, the japanese culture. If you are not familiar with that you can end up rating this place 0/5 and ranting about. In Japan space is a luxury, time even more. Eating out is supposed to be quick, you order, dishes are quick to prepare, you eat on the bar and take a hike. Siting around and chattering is not in their mentality. (That is true a little bit for germans to). So that's why the don't take reservations, why the tables are small and they use benches not chairs (if they were really traditional japanese then you would be eating on the floor). Further the staff mostly can't speak a word german, or english for that matter. And Japanese attitude and manierisms look aggressive to beginn with. This stuff can lead to misunderstandings easily.

The tables are small, but that doesn't matter. There is plenty of space, and even though we had to wait for about 10 minutes at lunch time, on a Thursday, it was worth it. The staff is very friendly, English and German are spoken. This Naniwa is across the street from the other sister place that specializes in Sushi. I would go back, the food is great.

After waiting in line for 30 minutes to get a table (as you cannot book beforehand), and after several assurances from a waitress that our table would be ready in 5 minutes (without us asking), the owner of the restaurant suddenly storms out and starts talking to us in a very aggressive and rude manner, saying that we are not welcome in his restaurant. When asking what has caused this sudden and totally unexpected outburst of curses, he simply states that he has no room for 7 persons at the moment, and further, he does not need us as his restaurant is already full, still talking in a very aggressive manner. All of us are shocked at this outrage, asking if this is the way to speak to clients. The owner repeats the same things, that this is his restaurant and that he has no need for us. Please note that we did not question the ownership of the restaurant, nor ask if he has any use for us as guests. It goes without saying that we found his rantings seriously bizarre, and normal behaviour would have been to have anyone from the staff informing us 30 minutes earlier in a nice, civilized way that they cannot accomodate 7 people that particular evening and that would have been fine. Now his aggressive manners were just a huge let down. Here is me thinking that you threat your clients (like everyone) in a polite and well behaved manner. Obviously that was asking too much.

I thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant, the atmosphere, the Turkish beer, the food and the super friendly staff. I cannot say a bad word about the place. I read one review that said portion sizes were small!!! Definitely not the case tonight. My mum and I shared a cold meze platter for starters. There was hummus, aubergine, artichoke and lovely warm Turkish flatbread. We also tried the cheese pastries which were fantastic. For a main we had swordfish with rice and mixed vegetables (See photo). There was a slab of swordfish that was perfectly cooked. The rice was tasty and the portions were plenty. We were so full we couldn't eat desert!!! In between meals the staff tended to us, made conversation and made us feel at home. The restaurant was almost full all evening, (It was a Sunday), and everyone who was in there seemed happy, had photos taken with staff and left by saying they really enjoyed the place. Don't get me wrong, you could save a few Euros by eating elsewhere in Dusseldorf but for a touch of Turkish Class this place is well worth a visit. I really need to plan another visit to Dusseldorf so that I can sample other goodies on the menu and the deserts too. Yum.

The price was very reasonable for the quality and quantity of courses we were given. Each one was excellent, stylish and delicious. Staff were very friendly, especially Lisa who looked after us for the evening. We particularly enjoyed the quirky courses such as an amuse bouche with a surprising musical element (don't want to spoil the surprise!) and an intriguingly named dessert which was creative and fun. Some great flavour combinations, I really loved the kingfish and my partner particularly loved the steak strips.
