But then you step inside and are transformed into a soothingly dark with modern and bright highlighted colors, tasteful furniture and charming staff, most of whom are try-lingual (German, Spanish, English). The Pisco Sour is superb, by far the best I have tasted outside of Lima. We ate the Nauta appetizer plate, a brilliant assortment of fish, vegetables and meat. The pulpo was divine. Then we shared three mains: the A Mar, poached salmon in a unique sauce with muscles and vegetables (and grapes) on the side, a roasted duck with lentils in a curry sauce and the tastiest lamb concoction I have ever eaten. It is not traditional Peruvian. It is Peruvian ingredients and base recipes, infused with influences from Japan and a bit of South Asia. This is truly original cuisine, a masterful creation. Those who complain about the pricing have clearly not been to good restaurants in other parts of the world for these prices are reasonable (we ate and drank to our hearts delight for 45 Euros each.

Then....oh surprise...there will be only ceviche (3 different ones) as appetizer and only barbecue meat or fish with \"tamale\" bits and only 2 desserts and nothing else (I guess, the 50 people had preordered...) - but ok, it is raining outside and you are really hungry and only have 45 min to eat...The Pisco Sour was ok, the ceviche not bad, but it had very little \"leche de tigre\" and no corn at all. The barbecue was nice, but instead of the \"tamales\" they server 2 fried puree balls (really?). As portions are not huge, there was still space for dessert, and while I don't regret it completely - the cilantro sorbet was awesome - it was just \"modern design on a plate\". Cancha came only on request...Service was OK-ish but one of the servers did not even know what they had available...and the music...oh the music was so loud...I am happy I was there alone, because...holding a conversation would have been impossible. All in all, I went there to get Peruvian food, and I got a ceviche and Pisco Sour, but everything else...was definitely not Peruvian and not Nikkei (in fact none of the Nikkei dishes except the Nikkei Ceviche was available).

The green garden breakfast with eggs and but loaf was really tasty. There were loads of gluten free options. We spent 2 hours there so not a place to go if you're in a rush. Service can be a little slow because it is very busy but it's well worth the wait. I'd 100% recommend this place to anyone looking for a cosy place to sit and drink coffee, read a book and have some nice food. Even though it was busy we were never rushed off the table once we'd finished.

Firstly it came with half an unpeeled unripe avocado, very very thick slices/chunks of smoked salmon, two very greasy fried eggs and tonnes of a sauce which I couldn't even identify hiding underneath.

It was nearly impossible to attract their attention. There was only one sommelier who was over worked so when he belatedly arrived at our table the experience felt pressured and uncomfortable. I would have preferred to be able to make my own selection in that case. Finally almost all the dishes were excellent except the steak which was literally the size of a postage stamp and the thickness of a wafer biscuit; a bad joke. It was served with sauce which if you correct the steak to a 100g would have meant it was served with half a litre of sauce; just plain idiotic.

Service was outstanding; friendly, not at all stuffy or pretentious, and very informed. The wine pairing was spot on. Some inventive choices, and all good. I opted for the six course degustation menu, and every course was well portioned and magnificently presented. Now, the not so good. The food was just, well, bland. Not a single course delivered the flavor punch that one expects from Michelin-starred food. And every course was under-seasoned. Why is it that so many Michelin star chefs have a love-hate relationship with salt? Would it kill you to include a salt cellar on the table? Ultimately, a restaurant has to be judged on the taste of it's food, and this was the one area where Lorenz Adlon fell short. Perhaps it was an off night.

As we are unfortunately on a budget we opted for the cheapest option which wasn't cheap as suggested by our waiter we had a starter of prawn in coconut followed by a trout fillet and braised short rib and beetroot themed dessert. Now the prawn starter was strange, quite sickly due to sweetness of the coconut we think if the chef used more citrus to take the edge off it would have been a lot easier but it was nice I think. The trout was also not as expected perfectly cooked but not mine still had a bone in (at this point I was tempted to swallow and choked in hope of getting a reduction off the bill) potato puree was lovely though and it was delightful besides the bone. The short rib oh it was the nicest beef I have ever eaten and my boyfriend also agrees it was perfect sweet and cooked medium rare tender and I wish I could have a whole cow's worth - compliments to the chef it was absolutely divine. Beetroot desert was also faultless just beautiful with so many different flavours that completely worked perfectly together. Additionally we had loads of complimentary dishes from the chef which were presented beautifully and amazed us it was such a surreal experience unfortunately I haven't the money or class to do this again in my lifetime but thank you to all the waiters and drink experts and chef's for providing myself and my boyfriend such a remembered experience and making us feel like royalty for the night.

We shared a Bruschetta for a starter and then my wife had the lasagne and I had the Truffle pasta. Both were very good. Giorgio finished the pasta at the table with a flambe finish to it in the giant half of a parmesan cheese which was cut into to add parmesan shavings and then had fresh black truffle grated on it. It was very nice indeed. The wine by the 50cl carafe was lovely, we had the Montepulciano which was light and fruity and at only 7.70 euros meant we could indulge and have two. The meal was lovely, the ambiance and friendliness of Giorgio and his staff made the whole evening a great experience, and then the complimentary grappa and Limoncello just finished off the meal superbly.

Conversely, this is bad for the diner who can only reject disliked courses, but cannot have a substitute. That said the food was exquisite and the service was superb, but it is horribly expensive considering the restrictions forced on the customer.

{"Review": ["The star of FACIL is the food: innovative, clever, and excellent. Most memorable was a tartar of beef on a bed of shallots (confit, I think) with caviar on top, which was worth the visit. Also superb was a dish I can hardly even describe with crab. The fish was cooked such that it melted in the mouth. Another beef dish had a marvellous reduction (of wine, I suppose) on top, like icing, with a plum reduction (but savoury) on the side. The room is unusual: a sort of inverted terrace with the roof open in the middle, and the hotel all around it (so no view). It's meant to be like being in a private garden, and mostly works, but it's a little strange, and the fountains make one think it's raining all the time. The service was ok but not great: perfectly friendly but lacking personal touches. This might be because we chose to converse in English (in my mind I'm comparing to Pauly Saal, where we mostly spoke in German), so the staff wasn't totally comfortable. In any case, nothing to complain about really, but I didn't find the sommelier helpful, and the wine we had was good, but not memorable. Perhaps I chose badly, or perhaps the sweet spot for their wine is a little more expensive. Anyway, quite worth the (large amount of) money.

{"Review": ["Yes. Surely. One of the best restaurants - definitely one of the very best in Berlin. I've visited this establishment twice. First time a couple of years ago when they held one Michelin star and I was very impressed. Now, some years later, they still impress, but what has happened between the first and the second star? When restaurants get high acclaim formally - for example getting Michelin stars - the nervousness raises simultaneously. My first experience with Facil, then holding one star, was the impression of simpleness and relaxation. Also, the youthful eagerness to get further. Now, when two stars are eminent, the \"stiffness\" starts to show. Don't get me wrong, they ARE good! But some \"fuzziness\" that didn't show previously now can be observed. In this type of restaurant your (ladies mostly) handbags are placed on elevated pillows, your napkins are placed on your lap (a bit too personal for some) and you are served everything from a side bord - including tap water (leitungswasser).

We chose to do all the courses except for one (so seven total).

The service was impeccable - as top-notch as the food. The waitstaff effortlessly switched back and forth between English (which my husband speaks) and German (which I speak).

On this occasion, we weren't disappointed. The food was first class, just what you expect from a Michelin star restaurant, at Michelin star prices and the service was faultless, everything came just at the right time. We had 4 courses from the set menu and with all the little extras in between, that was plenty. The restaurant is in a tranquil setting surrounded by glass, with lots of space between tables. The only negative point, our table was in the middle of the restaurant, not ideal for observing the action however all the tables on the sides were given to what appeared to be regular customers and if we lived in Berlin, we'd definitely visit Facil on a regular basis."], "Review_title": ["Amazing food in elegant surroundings"], "Star": 5.0, "Rating_Date": ["June 7, 2015"], "Restaurant_Name": [" FACIL "]}
{"Review": ["Another reviewer exited elevator but had difficulty discovering the entrance. Perhaps walking towards the only possibility would reveal the rest of one's question about the restaurant. About 35 feet before the entrance two wide doors open revealing the interior entrance to a beautiful dining room with widely spaced white table cloth room with water feature inside and out. All glass walls look out on a rear patio and well planted surround. Now to the food. After about 5 different amuse bouche presentations our first through third course were also presented and interspersed with more small tastings, finally ending with an overwhelming end of desert followed by another plate of equally interesting deserts. The food was all different and interesting albeit small portions (fortunately). A complete discription of each course will tell you nothing of what will happen when you visit. My only complaint would be lack of more fish offerings, but that's not about their ability to present food as entertainment. The service was excellent, and I'd compare it to 3 star Michelin when I've been able to book in France. It wasn't the best meal I've had, but it rates in the 10 best and includes meals as a Chaine de Rotissuers member . The wine list was excellent, but my wife didn't want any, and the glass portions I had of available wines were very good and reasonably priced.

The sweetbreads were visually fussy, (and not to our liking, but perhaps we are not sweetbread fans). The beef dish was good, but not exceptional. We decided not to have pudding, opting for a coffee instead - this came with a delicious little strudel-style bite to eat and some (hazelnut?) mousse, which was also very good, but which unfortunately looked very much like a little poo! In brief, it wasn't for us - we didn't enjoy the key courses enough to feel it was worth the price tag - we have enjoyed many meals in establishments of this kind, and didn't feel it lived up to expectations.

Everything about this place made me smile and having lunch here genuinely made me feel happy. The restaraunt is in a conservatory style room in which the light comes flooding in. The room and the restaraunt is modern, airy and chic without being pretentious. The staff are fantastic - what you would expect in a Michelin star establishment. They are friendly and helpful and put you at ease - not at all stuffy. We chose three courses from the set lunch menu and our wine waiter recommended a suitable wine that would go perfectly with our meal - it really did - it was an excellent choice. Four glasses cost us 40 euros - steep but we expected this based on previous reviews and we were there for a special occasion. In addition to our three courses we also got 2 \"amuses bouches\" before the starter arrived and an extra \"desert course\" of sorbet at the end of the meal. We have healthy appetites and we were full after the meal. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The flavours are delicate and all compliment eachother. I thoroughly recommend the cheek of Bison - outstanding. My husband's apple desert was his favourite part of the meal.

Tonight when I went to Hackethals, the veg item was spaetzle, perhaps the ideal thing I wanted before leaving. A night and a day in Munich this week led me to two other spaetzle experiences. Both were good, but Hackethals was, by any comparison, great. The noodles and cheese were a perfect balance of flavors and consistencies; where the cheese in Munich had chunked a bit and been somewhat stretchy, at Hackethals, the spaetzle was smooth and keenly balanced in its cheese oils and flavors. Niels and Alex (I hope I have that right) were the hosts, and there might've been a total of 30 seats at all of the restaurant's tables combined. I had no reservation but showed up at 630PM, and they seated me easily but also noted that they were full for the night (something they repeated on the phone a bunch of times while I ate). Both of the hosts also waited on tables, and Niels offered me their house dark lager, which paired wonderfully with the spaetzle. Throughout my meal, we talked about the restaurant's 20 years in business, its neighborhood clientele, and the fact that the food just blew me away. Easy, fabulous, filling. Perfect. And that was before dessert. They keep 3 desserts on the menu. My options were a couple tasty sounding puddings and an apple strudel and ice cream plate, which I chose. Had I the appropriate jaw power, I would've eaten the plate to keep the strudel and ice cream and vanilla/chocolate sauce going. An ideal bookend to the meal. So, you don't have to panic and call weeks ahead. But don't snooze on calling until it's too late. Plan perhaps a day ahead, as the neighborhood appears full of families and people who simply love Hackethals. And they love it for a really good reason: It's awesome in every regard. For reference, Hackethals was 4 U-Bahn stops from my hotel near Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden. The neighborhood is quiet, and the restaurant is tucked in about 2 blocks from the Schwarzkopfstrasse U-Bahn stop. Worth the train ride and the reservation and the plan and time.

{"Review": ["We booked a table for a dinner here with some high expectations - due to reviews and the Michelin hype. We tried 90% of things from both menus. Some were up the snuff and some where not. I had the impression some dishes required an additional thing or two to tie in the whole palette of flavors (artichoke with Parmesan for example). However, some dishes were amazing (sea bass, duck liver and lamb were delicious) and it was worth the visit. Service was nice but it did feel at times they lack a server or two (no palette cleanser before meat and the it took 20 minutes for the course to arrive). Some senior servers were definitely better informed on the food while some juniors were not on the Michelin quality level - this did not impact the overall impression much as everyone so super friendly and welcoming.

The burger taste and quality was average. We requested 2 beef burgers and asked one to be medium and the other well done, but both of them arrived cooked well done. We also ordered sweet potatoe fries with 2 different dips. The fries were very tasty and crunchy but the sour cream dip was too watery, it was dripping off from the fries.

Four or Five course menus with vegetarian options as well. The servers are beyond hospitable. Genuinely nice people trying to make sure your experience is a great one. My husband went crazy for the truffle risotto and he has it everywhere we go. Although some people have claimed it was expensive, we found quite the opposite. Compared to NY, LA, or even Amsterdam they were extremely reasonable for what you got. The wine menu is also very eclectic strongly driven towards the whites. I understand they're trying to highlight the more Eastern European wineries but a little more variety would be nice. We did have a very nice Hungarian red though.

{"Review": ["Pequena Habana is a great little restaurant, which far surpassed my previous experience of South American food (though Cuba is not exactly S America). The food was of excellent quality and presented in a very beautiful way- it didn't feel heavy or greasy like some Mexican food can do. Do try out the plantain chips for a starter, I was suspicious of the concept but as a friend told me they were good I thought I would give it a go. And she was right, they were fantastic! Really thin and crispy and served with interesting dips. For mains we had the steak with beans and rice, and a special prawn dish, they were both fantastic. Well balanced flavours and cooked to perfection, with a little bit of spice in my dish. For dessert I had the creme brulee with coconut...yum, yum, yum...even my normally non-dessert eating boyfriend was impressed and I had to fight him for it! I finished off with a glass of rum and went home very happy indeed! Also a nice selection of open wines, we opted for the Nero D'Avola, which was great.

Her English was a little broken but we got the gist of what things were and were grateful for her attention. When the food came... WOW!! Delicious! I ordered fried plantain to start which was very tasty and came with different dipping sauces which were very colourful and full of flavour. We were also brought some bread with some kind of red tomato/spicy paste which was very nice. I ordered shredded pulled beef for a main which was also extremely tasty, bursting with flavour! It came with rice, re fried beans, plantain, some pastry parcels (haven't a clue what it was!) and again some tasty sauces - all very nice. My partner ordered fish which came as a full fish and he was impressed too. We also had a big bowl of salad brought each in between the starter and main and couldn't work out if it was complementary or if it came with the main but was brought out before. We also got some free shots of rum to end the meal! I had a mojito too which was fantastic!

They boast of serving only fresh fish and the fish they serve you are bought only on that day. They never serve fish which is more than a day old.

A rare experience in Berlin where the service quality is usually bad. My favourite during the last visit was the egg yolk with fresh vegetable, but there were many more superb dishes, like the \"flat shrimp\" or the superbly smoked eel with veal.

The service is great and attentive, particularly from the male waiter with dreadlocks who translated the entire specials menu for us in English. You can also request the English menu which they have available. We shared the antipasto plate for two as a starter. I had the beetroot gnocchi filled with mascarpone and walnut in a creamy parmesan sauce which was to die for, I have never had anything like it. It was packed filled with flavour and the gnocchi was so soft. My partner had the penne with salciccia (pork) in a tomatoey sauce. He also absolutely loved his meal and it was a very decent serving size too. We finished off with some vanilla ice cream with raspberries and a casatta. The prices were very good and we could not fault anything. We came early so we were lucky to get a table as most of them had been reserved so I suggest either making a reservation or going in early.

The seeded bread, is honestly one of the most delicious breads I have ever eaten!!! It was only one of three viarieties of bread. The amuse appealed to me instantly, as it was served on a flat heart shape stone!! ( I collect them) The menu is small, only 2 choices of each course, but I could have chosen any of them, so it was not a problem!! The duck doughnuts were really memorable, with orange, and teriyaki, really delicious!! The red cabbage risotto served with the monkfish was ingenious, and a new experience for me!!

We also had the artichokes prepared in a white sauce which was good, but I preferred the salumi plate. Afterwards we all took a primo. I had the Gnocci in a cheesy white souce with -surprisingly- red beets, which I liked as it was very different, although I would recommend the different, more classic pasta's with tomato sauce and meets or vegetables.

{"Review": ["Like many Italians who left Italy and came to Germany and operate as Chef/Owners, they have modified Italian cuisine to suit the tastebuds of the region they are in the longer they have been there. Atmosphere is good. The service was very good between the Chef's wife and the waiter with the dreadlocks. House wine was good. There is no doubt that the Chef made his utmost effort to please me, but it was not successful. I would probably not go there again. I spoke to a large table of diners next to me and they seemed very happy with their pasta dish choices. Here's the review of my meal. I thought I would be adventurous and order the Chef's Surprise Menu which came with many large courses (way too much food in each course). The Vitello Tonnato was good, the Mozarella alla Caprese was boring and the balsamic vinegar was low quality. The Pasta e Pomodore was marginal at best. The Gnocchi on the other hand were FANTASTIC and filled with spinach and goat cheese (this with the Vitello Tonnato should have been my entire meal). The main course was two different types of fish, that no longer tasted as fresh as I expected (sole and perch) and had sauces that were the Chef's creation, but to me were not \"Italian\" in nature.

The caponata with mozzarella was fantastic as a starter but was so big, I could hardly manage anything of my main course. Bread and olive oil also put on the table. A guitarist popped in for a bit of singing etc which added to the atmosphere. Our Sicilian wine was good as was the service. Nice story at the front of the menu about how the owners had arrived in Berlin from Italy and eventually opened their own restaurant. The chef (co-owner) popped out and said goodbye to us as we left.

It is all about the food. The food is fantastic. They have the traditional menu (very accurate) plus the day's menu displayed on the billboard. I went for the tomato cream/soup with ricotta and parmesan from the billboard which was exceptional.It was made from the start, I imagine as I ordered it and if I would stay in the main hall I would surely had the possibility to watch it.. The fresh rucola leaves made it top. The carpaccio di manzo was perfect, the meat, the rucola and the parmesan was first class. The main was the spaghetti with prawns, also from the billboard. I was asked if I am aware that it will be hot and it was :) It was same hot as delicious. The prawns were perfectly cooked (and grilled/baked ?).

One gets a sense of an old German setting (sans schmalz or kitsch) while enjoying some really inventive fare that will warm the foodie heart. What I found most thrilling was that the sommeliere paired a German wine with each course (plus a Sparkling Rhiesling as an apperitif): : the standouts were a dry Rhiesling from Rheingau with the cod course and a superb Beerenauslese with a delicious strawberry-based dessert. But even the Pinot Noir that went with my expertly cooked lamb was from Germany -- I was really astonished. (Yes, I know Germany has many fine wines, but it was still a feat to pair every course with a great German selection.) Even the relative temperatures of the wines were perfect -- the whites not too cold (coldest the dessert wine), the red not too warm. The only imperfection: a little too much salt on the otherwise lovely lamb, but that was nothing a single unfell swoop of the knife couldn't remedy. DId I mention the service was excellent?

Not like in Spain where the fish often gets put in warm olive oil before being served. I have come here several times over five years. I have eaten both fish and meat e.g. lamp chops. A few times we had Baron del Ley as red wine which was good. Chilled it is also good with fish when you eat it with grilled vegetables.

This place is busy, but Roger helped me and my husband find a seat and was so kind and helpful to us when ordering. All the staff were incredibly friendly and all spoke English beautifully. My (gluten-free) caprese salad was grabbed from the cooler, dressed and tossed in the kitchen with chicken, and served to me on a tray with fresh bread that looked SO delicious. I would have devoured it if I could eat gluten. My husband ordered the hummus and avocado sandwich and the kitchen warmed it and brought it out to him at our table, along with a yummy cappuccino.

It is quite small, only a few small tables packed quite tight together, with precariously tall green candles which make navigating between tables a bit dangerous. Nevertheless, the young staff are friendly, spoke pretty good English and patiently explained the daily dishes (no menu, just on black board) to us. We ordered the white asparagus (in season) with pork medallion and same with salmon. It is quite delicious, especially the pork, had very rich taste. Another night we ordered pork knuckle, huge portion, very soft and delicious (even better than the one we tried in Prague.) If you plan to visit, be sure to check their opening hours.

The second explanation was that one of our group of 4 adults had ordered a small cold starter dish (served after 50 min). Is ordering a starter automatically prolonging the time for the main course to an hour and a half?). No time was wasted in recommending a wine to us - everything was rush-rush, a small bottle of water for the 7-year old took over 60 minutes from the kitchen to our table. When our ordered main dishes finally arrived, two plates were not preheated and the fish (sole) was served n a lukewarm condition at best on a cold plate, garnished with cold and watery vegetables.

You could taste nothing else unless you scraped each item totally clean because just a tiny bit of the stuff was so strong in flavour that it overpowered any other flavour.

We made sure to book before hand, which I'm glad we did as its a very small restaurant. We also took a cab from where we were staying in the Alexanderplatz as it look to be quite a few stops on the u bahn. I'm glad we did as its still classed as central location but it all depends on where you are staying in Berlin. It took 10 mins in a cab. On arrival we were greeted by the owner and his son, very warm welcome but we were pleased we book because it was busy. The son will read you the menu from the blackboard (unless you can read German) they change the menu frequently. We had slow roast pork, potatoes dumplings and red cabbage with a amazing gravy. Nearly as good as my mums . Then I had traditional apple strudel and my husband had chocolate mousse. All I can say about the food is fantastic,mouthwatering and real German food experience. You must be prepared to wait for you food though as its all cooked from scratch and I believe only one chef. We were served very quickly but others not so, but they haven't booked.

There is no printed menu just a chalkboard with about six dishes available. The beers was very good and the service excellent. The food was plentiful and cooked to perfection.

Its a small pub restaurant family run business. The father and son were great and friendly. Cute relationship. Father speaks german and limited english. The son speaks fluent english. They dont have an english menu but he explains the menu one by one for you and describes in great detail. I had the boiled traditional pork knuckle and my friend had the paprika with minced meat. The parika dish was apparently a new dish on the menu. We were not dissappointed at all! Both of the meals were great. The pork knuckle meat seems to be slow cooked for a long time. The meat was so soft and tender it falls off the bone. The other dishes i seen alot of customers order were the veal liver and schnitzel in mustard and cream sauce. Pity we didnt get to try those! All looks so good. Highly recommend this restaurant to drop by! Affordable prices! For the portions. They have wide selection of beer and a beer brewed specially for the bar. Dark lager with a sweet taste. We went with that. First time trying the dark lager and it was great! Would love to come bk again if i was in berlin!

Then he litterally went down the ENTIRE menu in English explaining the local asparagus and bratwurst, and all the other wonderful German cuisine they had to offer.

{"Review": ["Went to Hackethals on our first night after reading TA reviews and wanting traditional German food. Cannot comment if it was truly traditional as have no comparison however was tasty. I had the Schnitzel and my husband had beef tongue. Doesn't sound appetising but it was, I though he was game to try it but was delicious. The menu is on a blackboard and the bartender will explain to you in English so you understand not a huge menu but enough to please everyone. It was reasonable portion sizes for a female however a male may find them a bit small and wasn't a cheap meal I would say $$$. There is apparently a daily special according to website that is cheap and we believe the local next to us had it but we were not offered it. His portion size was smaller than mine but cheaper. Ask for the specials if you go. Service was very friendly and helpful. I probably wouldn't return due to the price and would rate higher for same reason but it's worth going if you want something different in a quiet area.

{"Review": ["We had a great evening out here but I think some previous reviews are misleading. This isn't a restaurant, rather a pub set in a residential area some way from a U-bahn. They offer a limited menu of great home-style food - no pretence, no frills, fine dining it ain't. No starters but 7 or 8 mains (including a veg option), and 3 simple desserts. The food is rustic, and filling, from sausages to ham shanks (described as pork) or braised beef, typically served with sauerkraut, boiled cabbage, boiled or mashed potatoes, etc. The menu varies according to what they buy in on a weekly shop, so don't rely on having what some one else may have had (eg no schnitzel on the night we went). Food is brought to the table with only a little delay after ordering, and after they have delivered the \"it goes with everything\" mustard pot. Beers, wines and spirits all good and inexpensive, and if you're lucky the kindly English speaking owner will ply you with complementary schnapps. The waitress was equally friendly, English speaking and helpful - in fact a joy. It's fun and it's busy, and quite small - you are advised to book ahead.

Instead, these lovely people brought us a complimentary glass of Champagne each to enjoy while they hurriedly found us a table. Ten minutes later we were installed in a cosy booth. The food was great, the prices very reasonable, and the charming waiters made a fuss of my young son. Overall the service was way beyond the call of duty.

The staff were friendly and attentive - and explained very well what each dish was if we weren't sure - and were definitely Italian. To start I had a Tomato and red Onion Salad, and we also had a Fig Bruchetta, which i was a little anxious about (Telling myself I'm not keen on Figs) - But - I tried half the portion and it was delicious. I had the homemade potato Gnocchi with basil pesto and sheep's cheese for the main. I have to say I was a little overwhelmed by the strong taste of the Pesto during the first few bites, but by the end of the dish I was certainly a convert. Very vibrant and very tasty. My friend had the Spaghetti Pomodorro - and has many different versions from various restaurants and said he thoroughly enjoyed it here at A Mano. The wine we chose was very light, and went very well with all the courses - thank you to our waiter who suggested it. We finished with Tiramisu - what I can say - absolutely delicious, a nice sized portion with a background taste of alcohol - and so creamy and light - Wonderful. The restaurant for early on a Saturday night was busy and by the time we left was extremely bust with people queuing outside to get in!! - The cost was very reasonable for 2 people - in fact we were pleasantly surprised it wasn't a lot more.

Coming over to translate and explain the small, traditional menu for us, he then chatted to us in English & took great care of us all night - even offering us tips on where we should go during our stay. We both chose a steak & it was cooked to perfection, with a fantastic sauce. We sampled 3 of the beers on tap - including their own brew - and enjoyed all of them. If we hadn't run out of money, we'd gladly have stayed for several more drinks. As it was, we weren't allowed to go before a goodnight shot with Frank's son. We went back on our last night for a last glass of wine and met another of the team - a very friendly barmaid who also made us feel right at home.

{"Review": ["We wanted to eat some traditional German food while drinking some good German beer, and was a bit sceptical about this place - but boy, were our doubts assuaged. A very local pub tucked away on a quiet street, we sat outside to enjoy the good weather and were quickly met by Paulina. She was very helpful and friendly, she knew that we were tourists and immediately tried to translate the menu even though English is not her first language, making recommendations as well. She brought out our food and drinks promptly, coming out every now and then to check on us and make conversation. We were extremely impressed by the pleasant service, she made us feel incredibly at home and not like tourists at all. Food and beer was great, and do was the atmosphere - the bar is very interestingly decorated, with - as Paulina tells us - some furniture from the early 1900s. The owner periodically came out and offered us free vodka shots as well. The place wasn't busy when we went (a Sunday night) - and we felt very well looked after. Awesome place - we can't recommend it enough, it was an excellent way to end our Berlin trip. If you want traditional German food with a local touch you can't miss this place, you won't regret it.

{"Review": ["On a rainy January evening in Tryp hotel me and my girlfriend were searching for a german style pub with good reviews thats close enough to walk. And finding Hackethals was the best that could have happened to us on our last night in Berlin. As we walked in we got a big warm welcome from the owner and his son, Frank and Nils. Place is away from tourist area, so mainly the rest of the punters were local. Its a small cosy old fashioned looking pub. They offer just around 5-6 main courses, but they do that only because they want to offer people freshly cooked food, not frozen rubbish. And oh boy, the argentinian steak was so tender, that it melted in my mouth. no need for steak knife either :) also the pork medallions were great. Besides other beers they have a beer under their pub name, and without knowing the abv, we drank couple of pints of it easily :) After the service even the chef Ben joined the evening. We had a great chat with Frank, Nils and Ben and some locals and had a drink together as the atmosphere was so friendly and welcoming. Thank you guys for a great send off from Berlin!

The owner Frank and his son, Nils, made us feel welcome from the moment we approached the restaurant.

We ordered a pork shank with homemade sauerkraut & mash potatoes and the veal schnitzel with a salad & fries. Both dishes were excellent especially the pork as it was so tender it literally fell off the bones. We had the home brewed beer which was a cross between a pilsner and an ale with a hint of sweetness - unique and very nice flavor. The food portions are huge so we had no room for dessert but Frank & Nils came to our table with a bottle of very smooth Polish vodka - Zubowka - and we had a couple of toasts to round out our dinner.

They offer a small but incredibly delicious menu of authentic German cusine. Their house brew beer was wonderful as well! They seem to have a motto of quality over quantity. But above all, the staff is very cheerful and sincerely friendly!

{"Review": ["Located at a stones throw away from the train station i came to try out this place because i saw it on the number one spot for restaurants. I came around 3 in the afternoon so it wasn't really crowded however i could tell the place is really crowded because of all the reserved tables inside the restaurant. Even though the weather was great, i decided to sit inside since there were people smoking outside. The waiter was trying to convince us to sit outside however i didn't want to this lead to the waiter giving me and my family a slight attitude which kind of annoyed me. Im not gonna condemn this restaurant for bad service because another waitress took our order and she was really nice to us. We ordered a few different types of pasta and for dessert a tiramisu. Before the food is served, bread is given with olive oil, vinegar and olives. It was really good so we finished it in no time (and we were very hungry lol) the waitress was nice enough to give us another plate of bread. The pastas were cooked perfectly and the sauces were special in their own way. The aglio olio was by far the best I've ever had in a restaurant except it was a bit too spicy. There was one pasta with salmon and lobster sauce where they were very generous with the amount of salmon given. I highly recommend however the sauce is pretty heavy so you might want to share it with someone. The dessert which i had was tiramisu and it was excellent. It comes i a big portion and looks and tastes amazing!

{"Review": ["My husband and I just had a quick mini-break in Hamburg and Berlin. On our last night in Berlin we were curious about trying an Italian restaurant as there are SO many in both cities. We were both tired from the exploring and were hoping that the #1 rated restaurant wouldn't let us down. On first arrival, the outside doesn't seem that inviting but once we stepped inside, the cozy feel and classy decor draws you in. It being a Sunday night at around dinner time, we were asked if we had a reservation (my husband suggested we call ahead but I nixed his idea-won't make that mistake again). When I said no, they took a look at the list and made the decision to squeeze us in. This was the beginning of some pretty incredible service. From the moment we walked in and walked out, all the staff was friendly and helpful. We were waited on by a couple of gentlemen and I wish we remembered their names. From the time they took to explain the specials (in English which took a little more effort), and the care with which we were treated throughout, it really made us enjoy the meal even more. About that meal! My husband was sold on the special which was the most incredible buttery spinach-y cheesy goodness I have ever tasted. I went for their tomato and basil soup which sounds boring but with a sprinkle of fresh pepper was hands down the best tomato soup I've ever had. The hubby went for a steak and gorgonzola and I had their gnocchi in marinara. Both mains were amazing! For dessert he had the chocolate mousse (his least favorite bit of the meal but to be fair, he normally doesn't like mousse, lol) and I had mango pana cotta which blew my socks off. To top it off, we were offered a shot on the house to complete our meal. As good as the meal was, the staff truly deserve the credit because good service really does go a long way. I would go back to Berlin JUST to eat at this restaurant. GO-it will be worth it!"], "Review_title": ["Deserving of that #1 spot...

{"Review": ["We booked this restaurant on the basis of the good reviews here and were not at all disappointed. It was easy to book online and as it was a birthday celebration I sent a confirmation email to be on the safe side as it is not a big establishment and it is very popular. It is not difficult to understand why. Service was excellent from beginning to end. Without exception the staff were professional and knowledgeable. Each of our party of four had a different starter and main course and we were all very satisfied with the high quality of the food and the presentation. Starters included spinach rolls, lamb carpaccio, goat's cheese salad; mains included tuna and 3 varieties of beef fillet. It was a delicious meal with a very decent Nero d'Avola at EUR25 per bottle to accompany the food. Do not be put off by the location or other reviewers' descriptions of driving through a council estate on your way to the restaurant. There is absolutely nothing to worry about in relation to that, and it is within very easy reach of U-Bahn Strausberger Platz and in dry weather in comfortable shoes an easy walk from Alexanderplatz. It is in former East Berlin and it is all part of the fascinating tapestry of this amazing city's history.

Next we had gnocchi with goat cheese and a sauce that was subtle but delicious. For the main we had pork medallions with a porcini mushroom sauce that was very good.

We were greeted when arrived, where they took our coats and seated us at a lovely window table. We ordered our drinks and main courses, we were pleasantly surprised to receive complimentary olives, bread and ham as an appetiser. Our main courses were delicious and the waiters were very attentive, checking to see that our water and wine were frequently topped up. We ordered the special 'pistachio parfait' for desert and it was mouthwateringly good. The presentation was exceptional and the food tasted equally as good. At the end of our evening they were more than happy to order us a taxi and for us to sit and relax at our table until it arrived. Overall the restaurant was fantastic, even the price was very reasonable for the quality and services.

{"Review": ["After looking at all the TA reviews for a decent restaurant for our trip to Berlin last weekend, I chose Ristorante A Mano......Possibly the best decision of the weekend! Firstly they have an online reservation service which is great especially if your Italian or Deustch is limited, however some of the staff speak excellent English. We arrived rather late as we got a smidgen lost as its slightly off the beaten track, but were met with a friendly greeting. The restaurant was absolutely packed which just displays the standard for food served. I opted for starters and main off the specials menu....what can I say except it was fabulous, my hubby had the steak, cooked to perfection and my daughter had the Tagliatelle with Chicken which she devoured and stated the best she had eaten. The goats cheese drizzled in honey was absolutely delicious and I could have happily licked my plate (I didn't though as I believe I have some etiquette!). For mains I ordered Sea Bass which was filleted at the table by our waiter, what a yummy dish served with an individual bowl of vegetables and potatoes. We managed to devour dessert, I'm not sure how but felt it rude not to. When the bill came I was very pleasantly surprised, it was extremely reasonable for such a high quality dining experience. When we return to Berlin we will definitely be making another reservation and now we know where it is we promise to be on time!"], "Review_title": ["Excellent service, cosy atmoshere and divine food"], "Star": 5.0, "Rating_Date": ["March 9, 2016"], "Restaurant_Name": [" Ristorante A Mano "]}

While the restaurant is certainly a good neighbourhood eatery, it is not worth traipsing across Berlin to visit.

Good advice on wine pairing and always in a good mood. The second time we came around. I had a calf-filet that was super tender and nice.

{"Review": ["We turned up at Ristorante A Mano last Friday around 8pm without a reservation. The restaurant was packed but luckily a couple were just leaving as we arrived so we only had to wait a few minutes before being seated by the friendly staff. The restaurant is furnished nicely with proper tablecloths and napkins. We were quickly brought some bread, olives and cold meat to eat whilst looking over our menus, which had a good selection of dishes. I had the garlic and chilli spaghetti for main which was simple but utterly delicious. My partner had the pork cheeks which came with a nice selection of vegetables and potatoes, which was apparently also very tasty. For desert my partner had the panna cotta and I had the Vodka lemon sorbet, both of which we would recommend! What we liked about this resturant is that we weren't rushed at any point - we were full after our main courses and it was nice to sit and enjoy our wine and the ambiance of the resturant without being given the desert menu immediately. Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Ristorante A Mano - the staff were friendly and helpful, the food was great and our bill was very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food.

The price on the menu was not the same as on the fee at one of the dishes. They did not offer to give me the price from the menu, and corrected the amount with a pen... so I gave them no tips! To bad, because the service vas very god, and they would have earned the xtra 10% on the fee.. ++ for making a special pizza for my son. He is kind of picky when it comes to food..
