{"Review": ["I have been living in Stuttgart West literally next door to the predecessor Wartburg for 5 years. Surprisingly, friends did invite me 15 years later for a dinner at Jose y Josefina and guys, that was mindblowing, I haven't had a clue that we talk about the same location but suddenly (ok, ok, actually 18 years in between are meant with \"suddenly\") I have arrived at a totally different place: interior is very stylish and what I have loved was the big table left to the entrance. Like a dinner table at home. Unfortunately not my company but we have seen about 10-12 people in very good conversation. That's what I would have expected for a family & friends dinner at home. However, we have been our own company of 6. First, service was very nice. Not overdone but I would label it as \"heartly\" which is a good fit to a Spanish (tapas) restaurant but not fine dining. Foodwise, excellent. I have ordered \"fish & chips\" which actually was fried anchovies with fries from sweet potatoes. Anchovies have been super good, sweet potatoes ok (give me more anchovies and let's forget the potatoe fries). As main course I have had monkfish: simply superb. Nothing to add, nothing to comment - simply fine. My wife had grilled octopus and here my review is mixed. One one hand it was great without any complaints. But on the other hand I have enjoyed more tendered ones - so, what to say? On its own, very good. Compared with others, they could do better ...

We were not disappointed. Finally, we were prepared an appetizer of kartoffelpufferen with home-made apple sauce which enhanced these potato pancakes. Our entrees of Schwinebraten and Schinkenspatzle were substantial, very good, and seemed to be made of local ingredients. In fact, the color of the yolk in the Schinkenspatzle was a deep orange, indicative of eggs recently arrived from a chicken on a farm where they are, probably, free range.

The staff was so friendly, they took time to stop and chat with us and explain the food and all...they spoke English as well, so that was a plus. My boyfriend is allergic to nuts, so when he couldn't eat one of the free taster deserts they gave us, they brought out more, nut free. The food was AWESOME too...Best steak I've had in Stuttgart so far. Really good wine choices as well. It was really just such a nice experience.

The food itself was slightly better than average but the overall experience was extremely poor. Choices were sent in prior to arrival and there was little flexibility to change the order when we arrived. The servers had zero organization on handling what everyone had ordered and seemed incapable of serving the group and each table could order and receive drinks and food only from their own server. We spent over two and a half hours for two of the three courses and decided to not stick around for dessert. It took an additional hour for everyone else to receive dessert and pay the bill (which they also could not handle well that we all had to pay individually). Along with the inflexibility, the host was saddled with four meals for people who ordered could not make it to dinner, but refused to server those meals to people who were willing to pay for a second meal.

While looking at the many exhibits, my wife and I caught the aroma of roasting pork wafting through the building. We soon became hungry for pork! After the museum, we made our way to the dining room ready to dive in to some schweinisch cuisine! To our surprise, there were very few (maybe three of four) items on the full menu that were pork dishes. There was vegetarian fare, a number of beef dishes, and a somewhat disproportionat offering of fish - but only a couple of dishes made of the meat of the pig so prominent throughout the rest of the building. I ordered the Schlachthof Klasik - a dish of braised pork in a goulasch-like sauce with band noodles. It was fantastic! I would not hesitate to order this dish again, or recommend it to a friend. My wife had a fried pork schnitzel, wich was also very good. I admit, I was hoping for barbecued ribs, but this is, after all, a German restaurant. We plan to visit again in the near future.

The chef should be cutting the snow peas into soup spoon sized pieces. The temperature of the soup was lukewarm. The crab in the soup was very fresh but overall the soup experience was a bit of a flop. The Foie Gras had an apple compote with orange garnishes and a orange syrup. Far too sweet and it overpowered the Foie Gras. Also I booked the Maserati guest shuttle but they picked us up in a Mercedes. There were five of us so I had told them ahead of time that I would follow in my Audi as I wanted my out of town guests to experience a ride in a Maserati. Needless to say, there was no need to be picked up in a Mercedes as I HAD an empty vehicle following.

{"Review": ["This is a great restaurant tucked away in a small town outside Stuttgart. Nothing 'small' about this place though. Their Swabian menu is far from typical fare with favourites such as 'Maultaschen' and 'Zwiebelrostbraten' packing a real punch. I ordered 'grilled tomatoes' to go with my steak which turned out to be stuffed with herbs, sour cream and cheese. Wow what flavour! The restaurant has simple flair, and a lovely warm atmosphere, made all the more so thanks to the excellent service and attention to detail of the owner Sebastian and his colleague who ensure that guests are well taken care of. My husband, who hails from the area, was very proud of the great local wines available on the menu. Although our Pinot Noir was more on the expensive side, it was worth every penny and a delicious choice for our meal.

Although very good by many standards the quality of the cut of beef fillet and tuna fillet were not up to the quality I expected after the first half of the experience.

The evening started unprofessionally with the allocation to a table that we haven't reserved, we specifically reserved a table close to the window, instead we got a table in the middle of the restaurant. The Cube menu is influenced by French kitchen but exotic stuff like a spicy Thai chicken soup is also on it (this is actually the best on the menu). In general all the dishes are high priced which puts the expectancies to a high level, sadly the quality of the dishes cannot meet this expectancies. Too spicy, too much salt, too much side dishes that don't go well with each other. To bring it to the point: No master plan, too less toughs were put into the composition of the dishes and with the price in mind this is totally unacceptable. This criticism also applies to the design of the restaurant. Generally it is a nice ambience with a great view but stuff like the rotating-lines screen savers on the bar computers are disturbing.

{"Review": ["Tucked away just off the U-Bahn Charlotten Platz, Weinstube Zur Kiste is a great place for tasty, hearty, local cuisine. Cosy is a great word to describe the place, with low ceilings, dark wood, and a traditional green-tiled ceramic fireplace. There is a tiny copper and wood bar that houses a dumb-waiter that is still used to bring food up and down from the kitchen. There are a variety of Stuttgart wines served from the viertele glassware, which is basically a stemless wineglass with a handle that we understand to be traditional of Baden-Wurtemburg. Even though we generally prefer darker, drier reds, like those of Bordeaux or Rioja, the local wines are easy drinking and simple, and their acidity pairs nicely with the rich food. As many others have commented, the roast beef \"rostbraten mit kartofel\" was great. The maultashen was good and fairly typical. The other dishes, such as the cordon bleu (the real deal) and meatballs also looked really nice. Finally, it is in a great bar district with lots of post-dinner options, so we recommend that you grab a meal and then walk off the hearty meal exploring the neighborhood for a nightcap."], "Review_title": ["Great traditional food and ambience"], "Star": 5.0, "Rating_Date": ["June 27, 2015"], "Restaurant_Name": [" Weinstube Zur Kiste "]}

We selected the restaurant on the basis of Tripadvisor reports and walked there to book in advance. Perhaps not being able to select a particular table one hour in advance might have given us a clue of what to expect but we did it anyway. When we returned everything started well, we actually got a nice table and the initial service was good. What followed was a bit of a disaster - a starter portion of Pizza bread to share was delivered almost at the same time as our mains. The mains were delivered an hour later - seemed like we were being punished. We wanted wine but the menu didn't show any so when we got one that did we were surprised to see that there were 'Specials' we did not know about. Also the red wine choices were a Cab Sav at 19 euros and a Barolo at 43 euros. After a closer look at the menu we didn't see was a wider selection of wines to choose from - poor indeed. In fact the mains were mixed, I ordered Spagetti Pomodoro which was pretty bland and my wife a Romana salad which was actually really good.

The others ordered a house specialty - pasta drenched in Reggiano, with truffle slices on top. The hot pasta is dumped into the open wheel of parmesan and mixed up right in the fresh cheese to create this buttery sweet dish topped by (what seemed not this time...) fresh slices of pungent truffle. This dish has always been a big hit with us. But today, the truffle was odorless and pretty much tasteless. Thankfully, the parmesan drenched pasta was its normal excellent.

If you love steak, you will be extremely impressed by the quality of the beef, and the skill of the wonderful chefs who cook it for you. A very nice Biergarten awaits you outside for the fine Stuttgart evenings. A great location in the best part of town, Stuttgart West.

The staff is very friendly and the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. As I was driving I enjoyed different fruit juices instead of wines which is the first time I experienced it.

Prices for drinks are the stuttgart average, so quite fair. We did not eat there, so i cannot say for the food. The atmosphere downstairs is relaxing, although it can get loud.

{"Review": ["I was at Restaurant 5 yesterday evening to grab a bite. As the place looked good I was excited about what to come. The waitress took very long before she came to help and her face was not exactly enthousiastic about the 2 people (us) that just joined. She even helped the people that joined later, but were obviously known to her, before she helped us. The weather was good so we sat outside. There was no opportunity to eat warm, only the cold dish was being served. It was mentioned after we already made our choice. The food and the Mohito were ok, not very exciting. In summary: worst treatment I had so far in Stuttgart. Food was mediocre and the place itself looked good."], "Review_title": ["Only attention for the wealthy and famous"], "Star": 2.0, "Rating_Date": ["July 8, 2012"], "Restaurant_Name": [" 5 "]}
